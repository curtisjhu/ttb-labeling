## Tech Specs

Cloudflare Front End

(ddos and basic network security)



A drag and drop.

batch, zip files.



GCP storage.


Backend using cloudrun


Using fastapi for simplicity. 
- I don't want to worry about scaling, and I want to be able to deploy quickly.
- I want simple. I want maintainable.
- Integrates well with AI services



Cloud function
- file processing
- file validation


Document AI vs Azure AI document intelligence
- It appears document AI solves exactly our issue. Done for driver license
- Multiple advanced technologies I ccan't reinvent the wheel here.

I believe its fine since its within the internal domain. Not blocked by firewall I hope.


n8n automations
- prefer zero - scaling for spotty

Common mistakes 
- 13.5% But TTB wants 13.5% Alc/Vol
- Forgot city + state for producer/bottler
- Government warning altered “just a little”

Common mistakes I can't check for:
- Front/back label confusion. Some imformation must appear together and not scattered. (NOT in the specs)
- Fonts too small
- Sulfites not declared (for wine). Must say Contains Sulfites if more than or equal to 10 ppm.
- Class/type doesn’t match the product (calling it wine when it’s malt-based)
- Imported products missing country of origin
- Brand name implies something illegal 
	- Gluten Free beer - must do paper work to prove it’s gluten free
	- Sugar-free wine - must do paper work to prove it’s sugar free



For single files this is rather slow since this pipeline was designed for batch processing.
